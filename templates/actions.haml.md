The actions bar holds several buttons that can be pressed to perform actions in
the editor.
    %header
      .actions
        - actions = @actions

Render a series of buttons, one for each action.

        %span
          - Object.keys(actions).each (name) ->
            %button(click=actions[name])
              = name.titleize()

The issues selector is also rendered in the actions bar.

        %select(value=@issues.currentIssue options=@issues.issues)
